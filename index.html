                                can't find these emails, they send phishing emails to other employees. They then scan for network 
                                vulnerabilities, which can take months. Once they gain access through these vulnerabilities or via 
                                compromised email accounts, they proceed to the next stage of their attack.

                            <p>Once hackers gain access to the network, they aim to move freely within it. To do this, they need higher 
                                access privileges, so they use tools like rainbow tables to steal credentials and elevate their access 
                                to administrator levels. With these privileges, hackers can navigate the entire network undetected. 
                                They then steal sensitive information to sell online, encrypt data to demand a ransom, or sometimes alter 
                                or erase data for reasons other than financial gain.</p>
                            <p>Note: Rainbow tables are pre-made lists of password hashes used to crack passwords quickly. Instead of guessing 
                                each password one by one, hackers use these tables to find the matching password for a given hash faster.</p>

                <h1>Subjects and Objects of Security</h1>
                 <h1>People</h1>
                 <p>Employees can create some of the greatest risks to cybersecurity. For example, cybercriminals might target 
                    employees with phishing e- mails to get them to click on a malicious link or divulge credentials.  </p>
                 
                 <h1>Processes</h1>     
                 <p>This layer of cybersecurity ensures that IT teams have strategies in place to proactively prevent and to respond 
                    quickly and effectively in the event of a cybersecurity incident. A good incident response plan will provide an 
                    organization with repeatable procedures and an operational approach to address cybersecurity incidents to recover
                     business processes as quickly and efficiently as possible.</p>    
    
                 <h1>Technology</h1>     
                 <p>It is important that IT teams do not implement isolated point solutions as they layer their defenses, but rather 
                    select those tools based on their ability to be integrated and automated to create a security fabric that can facilitate 
                    the rapid detection and mitigation of threats.

                            devices ensures that any device that seeks to be connected has the rights for connectivity to that particular network. </p>

                        generate daily. Both private and public entities have doubled up their data center security by the use of Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)

            <div class="first-box">
                 <h1>Security Policy</h1>    
                 <p>is a set of rules that applies to activities for the computer and communications resources that 
                    belong to an organization. The security policy defines what an organization wants to protect and 
                    what it expects of its system users.</p>
                 
             </div>
             <div class="first-box">
                <h1>Security Objectives </h1>
                <h1>Resource Protection </h1>
                <p>The resource protection scheme ensures that only authorized users can access objects on the system. 
                    As such, carefully define the different categories of users that can access the system.</p>
                    
                <h1>Authentication</h1>
                <p>The assurance or verification that the resource (human or machine) at the other end of the session really 
                    is what it claims to be. Solid authentication defends a system against the security risk of impersonation, 
                    in which a sender or receiver uses a false identity to access a system. </p>
                    
                <h1>Authorization</h1>
                <p>This is an assurance that the person or computer at the other end of the session has permission to carry out 
                    the request. Authorization is the process of determining who or what can access the system resources or perform 
                    certain activities on a system.  </p>
             
                <h1>Integrity</h1>
                <p>This is an assurance that the arriving information is the same as what was sent out. Understanding integrity requires 
                    understanding the concepts of data integrity and system integrity. </p>
                
                <div>
                    <h2>Data Integrity</h2>
                    <p>Data is protected from unauthorized changes or tampering. Data integrity defends against the security risk of 
                        manipulation, or the act of intercepting and changing information to which s/he is not authorized. </p>
                    
                    <h2>System Integrity</h2>
                    <p>The system provides consistent and expected results with expected performance. </p>
                </div>

                <h1>Nonrepudiation </h1>
                <p>This is the proof that a transaction occurred, or that a user sent or received a message. Both the sender and the 
                    receiver agree that the exchange takes place. </p>
                <h1>Confidentiality </h1>
                <p>This is the assurance that sensitive information remains private and is not visible to an eavesdropper. 
                    Confidentiality is critical to total data security. </p>
                <h1>Auditing Security Activities</h1>
